# pull-deploy.sh — poll origin/main; if HEAD changed, invoke the
# server-side /opt/ai-web-fetcher-deploy/deploy.sh which handles the
# heavy lifting (git reset, npm ci, build, systemd unit refresh, service
# restart). Run by systemd timer ai-web-fetcher-pull-deploy.timer
# every ~2 min on golden-ai-ops.
#
# Mirrors ai-calendar-adviser's polling-deploy pattern: cloud-egress
# webhook POSTs are unreliable from inside Anthropic's remote-trigger
# sandbox, so polling closes the loop deterministically.
#
# Stable runtime path: /opt/ai-web-fetcher-deploy/pull-deploy.sh
# (lives outside /opt/ai-web-fetcher so git resets inside the repo
# cannot wipe it). Source of truth is the copy in this repo at
# scripts/pull-deploy.sh; deploy.sh self-installs the stable copy on
# each successful run.
